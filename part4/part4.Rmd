## Getting set up

```{r prep, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)


smoke_complete <- read_excel("data/smoke_complete.xlsx", 
                             sheet=1, 
                             na="NA")
```

# `mutate()` - A confusing name, a powerful `dplyr` verb

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=1944>

```{r}

```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/dplyr_mutate.png")
```

So what is mutate? `mutate()` is one of the most useful `dplyr` verbs. You can use it to transform data (variables in your `data.frame`) and add it as a new variable into the data.frame.

I tend to think of this much like adding a formula in Excel to calculate the value of a new column based on previous columns. You can do lots of things such as:

-   subtract one column from another
-   convert the units of one column to new units (such as days to years)
-   change the capitalization of categories in a variable
-   recode a continuous variable to be a categorical one

## Using `mutate` to calculate a new variable based on other variables

One use for `mutate` is to do Excel type calculations using other columns on the data. For instance, we might want to calculate the sum of `age_at_diagnoses`and `days_to_death` to get the `age_at_death`.

```{r}
smoke_complete %>% 
    mutate(age_at_death = age_at_diagnosis + days_to_death) 
```

## Your Turn

Create a variable called `cigarettes_total` by multiplying `cigarettes_per_day` by `-days_to_birth` below:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    mutate(cigarettes_total = -------) 

```

## Using `mutate` to make our `character` variables into `factors`

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=2609")
```

Remember `factor`s? Well, we can use `mutate()` to make a `character` variable a `factor`.

Let's convert `gender` from `character` into `factor`. We'll then pipe the output into `glimpse()` so you can see the variable types.

```{r}
smoke_complete %>% 
    #reassign the gender variable to be a factor
    mutate(gender = factor(gender)) %>%
    glimpse()
```

One thing to notice: we are doing something called *reassignment* here. We're taking the previous values of our variable (`gender`), doing something to it (making it a `factor`), and then reassigning the variable `gender` to our fixed set of values.

Remember when we wanted to decide the order of the categories in the factor? We can assign that order using the `levels` argument in `factor()`. To show the order, we can pipe the output into a command called `tabyl()`, from the `janitor` package, which is a `tidyverse` friendly version of `table()`.

```{r}
smoke_complete %>% 
    #reassign the gender variable to be a factor
    mutate(gender = factor(gender, levels = c("female", "male"))) %>%
    tabyl(gender)
```

Notice that the `female` value goes before the `male`, which is what we wanted.

## Using `mutate` to replace missing values with `replace_na`

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=2878>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=2878")
```

Sometimes we want to fill in missing values with a certain value. We can use the `replace_na()` function inside of `mutate()` to specify this. For example, if the days to last follow up is missing, we want to set their days to follow up to 0. The first two observations in this data have missing follow up, but when we replace them we note they are now equal to 0:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    mutate(days_to_last_follow_up = replace_na(days_to_last_follow_up, 0)) %>%
    glimpse()
```

## Using `mutate` to make a continuous variable categorical using `case_when`

Link to Video: <https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=3085>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=3085")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/dplyr_case_when.png")
```

Say we want to make the `cigarettes_per_day` into a categorical variable with the values:

-   0-5 cigarettes/day
-   6+ cigarettes/day

How would we do that?

Well, we need to follow the basic pattern for each of our categories:

*condition* \~ *category name*

The *left* side of the `~` is where we can specify how we define the \*category&.

The *right* side of the `~` is where we can specify the *category name* (as a character).

In the example below,

`cigarettes_per_day <= 5` is our left side, and `0-5` is our right side (our category).

We need to do this for each level in our category.

```{r}
smoke_complete %>% 
    mutate(
        cigarettes_category = case_when(
            cigarettes_per_day <= 5 ~ '0-5',
            cigarettes_per_day > 5 ~ '6+'
            )
        ) %>%
    mutate(cigarettes_category = 
               factor(cigarettes_category,
                      levels = c("0-5", "6+")
                      )
           ) %>%
    tabyl(cigarettes_category)
    
```

## Your Turn

Modify the code below to recode `cigarettes_category` to have 3 levels:

-   `0-5`
-   `6-10`
-   `11+`

Hint: you'll have to chain conditions with a `&` to get the `6-10` category.

```{r}
smoke_complete %>% 
    mutate(
        cigarettes_category = case_when(
            cigarettes_per_day <= 5 ~ '0-5',
            cigarettes_per_day > 5 ~ '6+'
            )
        ) %>%
    mutate(cigarettes_category = 
               factor(cigarettes_category,
                      levels = c("0-5", "6+")
                      )
           ) %>%
    tabyl(cigarettes_category)
    
```

# `summarize()`

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=4368>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=4368")
```

The `summarize()` verb produces summaries across your data.

For example, if I wanted to find the average `cigarettes_per_day` across all my data, I'd do this:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    summarize(average_cigarettes = mean(cigarettes_per_day))

```

Note we need to be careful if there are missing values in the variable we are summarizing, compare these two results:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    summarize(average_yrs_smoked = mean(years_smoked))

smoke_complete %>%
    summarize(average_yrs_smoked = mean(years_smoked, na.rm = TRUE))

```

What are the kinds of things that summarize is useful for?

Useful functions (from <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html>)

Center: `mean()`, `median()` Spread: `sd()` (standard deviation) Range: `min()`, `max()` Position: `first()`, `last()`, `nth()` Count: `n()`, `n_distinct()`

By itself, `summarize()` is ok. But it's really combined with `group_by()` that it becomes extremely powerful.

# `group_by()/summarize()`

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=4575>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=4575")
```

These two verbs always go together. `group_by()` doesn't do anything by itself, output wise. But what it does is split our data frame into a number of smaller `data.frame`s split out by category. Then we use `summarize` to do some sort of summary calculation (such as counting or calculating the mean) on these smaller `data.frame`s:

For example, if we want to calculate the mean `cigarettes_per_day` smoked between `male`s and `female`s, we'd do the following:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
   group_by(gender) %>%
   summarize(mean_cigarettes = mean(cigarettes_per_day))
```

## `group_by()/summarize` to calculate mean and standard deviation values

Below, we'll calculate the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for males and females, and the standard deviation.

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    group_by(gender) %>%
    summarize(mean = mean(cigarettes_per_day), 
              sd = sd(cigarettes_per_day))
```

## `group_by()` to `count()` things

What if we want to know the number of subjects in our dataset with each type of `disease`? We can use the `n()` function.

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    group_by(disease) %>%
    summarize(count = n())
```

We can also use the `count()` function directly:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    count(disease)
```

## Your Turn

Use `group_by()/summarize()` to calculate the maximum cigarettes per day within each `disease` category.

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    group_by(------) %>%
    summarize(max_cigarettes = -------)

```

# `summarize()` and `mutate()` across multiple columns with `across()`

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=7228>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=7228")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/dplyr_across.png")
```

Often we may want to summarize or mutate multiple variables in the same way. We can follow the examples above and specify each operation individually. For instance, suppose we want to calculate the mean of multiple numeric variables:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    summarize(mean_days_to_death = mean(days_to_death, na.rm = TRUE),
              mean_days_to_birth = mean(days_to_birth),
              mean_days_to_last_followup = mean(days_to_last_follow_up, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Phew, that's a lot of typing! But there's an easier way:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    summarize(
        across(c(days_to_death, days_to_birth, days_to_last_follow_up), 
               mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The `across()` function used above, first asks which variables, then asks which operation. In the example above, we named the variables first, and then we named the function `mean` and added an argument `na.rm = TRUE` which is applied to the mean function. If we had not done this, we would have `NA`s in our results.

We can also use the syntax from `select()` to choose our variables, for instance, we could call the same variables by using `starts_with("days")`:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    summarize(
        across(starts_with("days"), 
               mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Or we can calculate the mean on all numeric variables:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    summarize(
        across(where(is.numeric), 
               mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Using `across()` takes some getting used to, but seeing more examples will help you see how it works. There are also more complex ways to use your own functions and naming conventions. Look at this vignette for many examples: [dplyr colwise vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html).

For an example of using our own function, we calculate the number of `NA`s across all columns with `everything()` and a custom function defined with `~` operating on the argument `.x`:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    summarize(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.x)))) %>%
    glimpse()
```

We can also use `across()` with `mutate()` in a similar way. For example, if we want to convert all character columns to factors:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    mutate(
        across(where(is.character), factor)) %>%
    glimpse()
```

## Your turn

Convert all variables that start with `days_to` into years:

```{r}
smoke_complete %>%
    mutate(
        across(starts_with(----), ~ .x/-----)) %>%
    glimpse()
```

# Standardizing variable names: `clean_names()`

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=5368>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=5368")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/janitor_clean_names.png")
```

The last package we'll talk about today is the `janitor` package. This package adds some really useful functions for *cleaning* data.

The one I use the most is called `clean_names()`. This will mutate column names into a standard format - all character values will be lowercase and spaces will be converted to underscores.

The `smoke_complete` dataset has already had this function applied to it, but let's create a smaller example dataset where this wouldn't be the case.

```{r}
smoke_bad_colnames <- read_csv("data/smoke_bad_colnames.csv")
smoke_bad_colnames
```

Ack! These column names have spaces, inconsistent capitalization, which make these difficult to work with.

So let's use `clean_names()` to fix this:

```{r}
smoke_good_colnames <- smoke_bad_colnames %>%
    clean_names()

smoke_good_colnames
```

By default, `clean_names()` converts to snake case (spaces between words are replaced by an underscore `_`). `clean_names()` will help you standardize your dataset's column names.

## Using `rename()` to rename!

We can easily change names by hand, as well, with the `rename()` function in `dplyr` which is essentially a wrapper for `mutate()`:

```{r}
smoke_good_colnames %>%
    rename(age = age_at_diagnosis) %>%
    glimpse()
```

# More `ggplot2` stuff

Due to the number of requests, I have added this section on `ggplot2`.

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/7KZWcICwF54?t=5743")
```

## `geom`s are layers on your plot

The really neat thing about `geom`s are that they can be layered onto your plot.

Here we're layering another geom, `geom_violin()` on `geom_boxplot()`.

We're providing a couple of values to `geom_violin()`:

-   `alpha`, which controls the transparency of the geom
-   `width`, which controls the overall width of the violins.

```{r}
our_boxplot <- ggplot(smoke_complete) +
    aes(y = cigarettes_per_day, x=disease, fill=disease) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.5)
    
our_boxplot
```

## Scales

Scales are added to a ggplot for multiple reasons:

-   Transform numerical axes (such as change a plot to a log scale)
-   Change the breaks (tick values) in a plot
-   Format values in a scale (such as dollars: "\$500", "600")
-   Map discrete values to particular colors (make "LUSC" = "blue")

All scale functions begin with `scale_` and are followed by the `aesthetic` it's working on, and the `transformation` of the data.

For example:

## Changing axis ticks and values using `scale_x_continuous()`

One main use for `scale_` functions is to modify the *breaks* (the tick values along an axis):

Here we're providing `scale_x_continuous()` an argument called `breaks`, which is a numeric vector that specifies the values we want each tick to be at:

```{r}
our_plot <- ggplot(smoke_complete) +

  aes(x = age_at_diagnosis, 
      y = cigarettes_per_day, 
      color = disease) +
  
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  
  labs(title = "Cigarettes per Day versus Age at Diagnosis",
       x = "Age at Diagnosis",
       y = "Cigarettes Smoked per Day") + 

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(10000, 20000, 30000))
  
our_plot
```

### Your Turn

How would you modify the `y` axis to have the following breaks?

c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

Hint: it's not `scale_x_continuous`, but `scale_y_continuous`:

```{r}
our_plot +
    scale_y_continous()

```

## Better Labels

The other main use for `scale_` functions is to improve the formatting on the axis tick labels.

Say our y axis was dollars instead of number of cigarettes. We can supply `label_dollar()` as an argument to our `labels` argument in scale\_y\_continuous:

```{r}
our_plot +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar())
```

Other useful label\_ functions for formatting labels:

`label_date()` - Lets you control the way dates are formatted on the axis `label_scientific()` - lets you format the labels with scientific notation `label_pvalue()` - formatting specific to p-values

## scale\_color\_manual() - mapping discrete colors to categories

If you want to customize the colors values in your data set are mapped to, you can use `scale_color_manual()`:

```{r}
our_plot +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("LUSC" = "limegreen", 
                                  "BLCA" = "orange",
                                  "CESC" = "pink"))

```

## Color Palettes: `{wesanderson}`

If you don't want to meticulously control every color, you can use palettes as a starting point for your

```{r}
library(wesanderson)

names(wes_palettes)
```

```{r}
wes_palette("IsleofDogs1")
```

```{r}
our_plot +
    scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("IsleofDogs1"))

```

Remember, if we want to do this with `our_boxplot`, the scale we want to manipulate is not `color`, but `fill`, so we need to use `scale_fill_manual()`

```{r}
our_boxplot +
    scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("IsleofDogs1"))

```

### Your Turn

Pick one of the palettes from `wesanderson` and use it to modify `our_plot`:

```{r}

our_plot +
    scale_color_manual(values = __________)
```

## `scale_color_gradient()`

We've talked about variables with discrete values, but what about variables with continuous values?

```{r}
ggplot(smoke_complete) +

  aes(x = age_at_diagnosis, 
      y = cigarettes_per_day, 
      color = year_of_birth) +
  
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  
  labs(title = "Cigarettes per Day versus Age at Diagnosis",
       x = "Age at Diagnosis",
       y = "Cigarettes Smoked per Day") +
  
  scale_color_gradient(low = "black", high="blue")


```

## Color Palettes: `{viridisLite}`

One really important package to know about is `{viridisLite}`, which contains a number of color-blind friendly palettes.

They have built in functions that use these:

For discrete values:

-   `scale_color_viridis_d()`
-   `scale_fill_viridis_d()`

For continuous values:

-   `scale_color_viridis_c()`
-   `scale_fill_viridis_c()`

```{r}
library(viridisLite)

our_plot +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

# More Palettes

The `{paleteer}` package has a lot of other palettes:
