```{r}

Given what we know so far about vectors, we might want to do something with each value in a vector.

For example, say I had the following strings:

```{r}

pets <- c("dog", "cat", "mouse")

for(pet in pets){print(pet)}
```

The curly brackets {} contain functions that you want to apply to each value in the vector. In this case, we're just printing out the values.


Let's take some miles per gallon readings and convert them to miles per liter. We know that there are 3.78 liters in a gallon:

```{r}
cars_mpg <- c(20, 30, 44.2)
#make an empty vector
cars_mpl <- c()

for(mpg in cars_mpg){
  mpl <- mpg / 3.71
  #add mpl to the end of cars_mpl
  cars_mpl <- c(cars_mpl, mpl)
}
```

We know `cars_mpl` is a vector. What does it contain? What is its length?

```{r}



```

## Vectorized functions

You might know that instead of doing the above, you can do this:

```{r}
cars_mpl <- cars_mpg / 3.71
cars_mpl
```

This has to do with the fact that many functions in R are *vectorized* - they know how to handle vectors when you given them a vector.

However, sometimes for loops are still very useful.
