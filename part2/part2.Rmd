# Welcome to Ready for R: Part 2!

In this session, we'll continue our introduction to R by working with a large dataset that more closely resembles that which you may encounter while analyzing data for research.

# Before you get started

Remember to save this notebook under a new name, such as `part2_laderas.Rmd`.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to:

1.  **Import** spreadsheet-style data into R as a `data.frame`.
2.  **Understand** properties of `data.frames`, especially variables.
3.  **Install** new packages to your R installation.
4.  **Utilize** `skimr` and `visdat` to gain an overview of your data
5.  **Visualize** `numeric` vectors in this dataset using `ggplot2`

## A note about Base R versus the Tidyverse

For the remainder of this course, we'll be focusing on using functions from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

It is set up as a *library* - functions someone else wrote that are not built into R. We'll use quite a few libraries in this course.

The Tidyverse is essentially a library of libraries -- each of these libraries contains functions that are either essential for or *greatly* simplify the process of data manipulation and visualization for data scientists.

We have already installed the `tidyverse` for you. For reading excel files, we also need to load up an additional library called `readxl`.

```{r warning=F, message=FALSE}
#load the required libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Importing spreadsheet-style data into R

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=3463>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=3463")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/project2.JPG")

```

Once you have your notebook open, let's talk about its location. It is located where the `project.rproj` file. The location of this file (also called an "RProject" file) is always considered the `root` directory of the project.

It's where you start from that determines the file directory path for loading data.

Since this notebook, `part2.Rmd` is in the same folder as the `project.rproj` file, then when we need to refer to data files, it is *relative* to the root folder.

When you're starting out, it's best to keep your RMarkdown notebooks and files in the **root** folder. It will help prevent you from dealing with a lot of headaches.

## A good place to put your data

Take a look at the `data/` folder, and where the `tcga_clinical_data.xlsx` file is.

In our notebook, how do we refer to that file name? Since we're in the root, we can refer to it as

`data/tcga_clinical_data.xlsx`

## Loading our excel file

Now we can use a built-in function called `read_excel()` that will help us load our data into R:

```{r}
brca_clinical <- read_excel("data/tcga_clinical_data.xlsx",
                            sheet = 1, 
                            skip = 1,
                            na = "NA"
                            )
```

You can see the excel file here: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E6jmCB9nfeIJ_zlSH6HJCUmKwwcMTWwP0EwEcAHo0CU/edit?usp=sharing>

You should see `brca_clinical` appear in the Environment window on the upper right panel in RStudio. If you click on `brca_clinical` there, a new tab will appear next to your R script in the Source window.

> Clicking on the name of an object in the Environment window is a shortcut for running `View(brca_clinical)`; you'll see this code appear in the Console after clicking.

## Challenge 1 (5 minutes)

Take a look at the documentation for `read_excel()`. This is a package in the package `readxl`, which is installed as part of the `tidyverse`.

1.  What does the `skip` argument do?
2.  Do we need to refer to a `sheet` within an excel file as a number, or can we refer to it as the sheet name instead?
3.  What does the `guess_max` argument do?

```{r}
?read_excel
```

[Your answers here]

Now that we have the data imported and assigned to an object, we can take some time to explore the data we'll be using for the rest of this course.

## Notes on the Data

-   These data are clinical cancer data from the [National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov), specifically from The Cancer Genome Atlas, or [TCGA](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga).
-   Each row represents a patient, and each column represents information about demographics (race, age at diagnosis, etc) and disease (e.g., cancer type).
-   The data were downloaded and aggregated using an R script, which you can view in the [GitHub repository for the fredhutch.io course](https://github.com/fredhutchio/R_intro/blob/master/0dataset.R).

## Challenge 2 (5 minutes):

Inspect, and import the following sheets from the `tcga_clinical_data.xlsx` excel file.

Confirm that you have loaded them correctly by clicking on the objects in the `Environment` pane in the top right.

1.  The `CESC` sheet. Save it as `cesc_clinical`.
2.  The `LUSC` sheet. Save it as `lusc_clinical`.

```{r}
#load cesc_clinical here

#What should be the sheet argument?

#do you need to skip a line?

cesc_clinical <- read_excel("data/tcga_clinical_data.xlsx",
                            sheet = ____, 
                            skip = ___,
                            na = "NA"
                            )  

#load lusc_clinical here

lusc_clinical <- 



```

Importing data can be tricky and frustrating. However, if you can't get your data into R, you can't do anything to analyze or visualize it. It's worth understanding how to do it effectively to save you time and energy later.

We will be covering loading in another format that you can export from many different software programs, the *comma separated value* format, or `csv` format in another section.

### Tips on Formating your Excel file for R

Here are some tips on formatting your data to get it into R easier.

Click on the code block below to load up a graphic.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/tidydata_1.jpg")
```

1.  **Tidy is Best**. Try to format your spreadsheet where the columns correspond to variables you're measuring, and a row corresponds to an observation.

In our example:

-   each row corresponds to a patient
-   each column corresponds to a *variable* of clinical data
-   each cell has a value

We'll be seeing that this format is called **Tidy Data**, and it lets us do all sorts of things in R successfully.

2.  **Transpose is your Friend in Excel.** If your data isn't in this format, no worries! You can copy it to a new sheet and use the *Transpose* option when you're pasting it, and then load that in.

3.  **Every column needs a name.** Every one of your columns should be named at the top, and should begin with a letter. Numbers and special characters can cause errors in your data analysis pipeline.

4.  **Color information is hard to get into R**. Avoid using color coding of cells if that is extra information attached to a cell. Instead, make the information the color is representing its own column.

5.  **Extra Lines are OK!** Extra lines before the column header are ok, as you've seen. It's sometimes better to have a "notes" sheet where you put extra information or, better yet, a data dictionary.

## Further Reading: Organizing Data in Spreadsheets

One paper I think you should all read is Kara Woo and Karl Broman's paper [Organizing Data in Spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989). This is one of the best papers about how to organize data that I know of.

The opening is one of my favorite sentences written about spreadsheets:

> Spreadsheets, for all of their mundane rectangularness, have been the subject of angst and controversy for decades.

And be sure to pass it on to your friends!

## One last bit of Tidy-related wisdom

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/tidydata_2.jpg")
```

## `data.frame`s

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/Ur-Lzkan8zI>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_youtube("Ur-Lzkan8zI", width = 600, height=300)
```

Now that we have data imported and available, we can start to inspect the data more closely. These data have been interpreted by R to be a `data.frame`, which is a data structure (that is, a way of organizing data) that is analogous to tabular or spreadsheet style data.

By definition, a `data.frame` is:

a table made of vectors (columns) of all the same length.

As we learned in our last session, a vector needs to include all of the same type of data (e.g., `character`, `numeric`).

A `data.frame`, however, can include vectors (columns) of different data types. This makes them an extremely versatile way of storing information.

## `data.frame`s - How do they Work?

<https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=6058>

To learn more about this data frame, we'll first explore its dimensions:

```{r}
# assess size of data frame
dim(brca_clinical)
```

This output reflects the number of rows, then the number of columns.

We can also preview the content by showing the first few rows:

```{r}
# preview first few rows

head(brca_clinical) 
```

## Column Names

We often need to reference the names of *variables* (also known as columns) in our `data.frame`, so it's useful to print only those to the screen:

```{r}
# view column names

colnames(brca_clinical) 
```

It's also possible to view row names using`rownames(brca_clinical)`, but our data only possess numbers for row names so it's not very informative.

## Okay, What's really in it?

We can use `glimpse()` to provide a general overview of the object:

```{r}
# show overview of data.frame

glimpse(brca_clinical) 
```

The output provided by `glimpse()` includes:

-   data structure: `data.frame`
-   dimensions:
-   column-by-column information: each prefaced with a `$`, and includes the column name, data type (num, int, Factor)

Identify the `numeric` variables (they are noted as `<dbl>` or `double`). What are they?

Another useful command is `View()` - it will open up a spreadsheet like view of our `data_frame`. You can also view this by clicking on the `brca_clinical` object in the `Environment` pane in the top-right.

```{r}
View(brca_clinical)
```

We'll see that `View()` can help you out when you're starting out with building data processing with `dplyr`, but that's for next time.

### Summarizing our Data

<https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=6528>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/yCPcijCj15c?t=1502")

```

Finally, we can also examine basic summary statistics for each column:

```{r}
# provide summary statistics for each column
summary(brca_clinical) 

```

For numeric data (such as `year_of_death`), this output includes common statistics like median and mean, as well as the number of rows (patients) with missing data (as `NA`).

For `factor`s (also known as categorical variables), and `character` variables, such as `disease`, you're given a count of the number of times the top six most frequent factors (categories) occur in the data frame.

We will talk more about `factors` in the next lab.

### `{skimr}`

A really useful package for understanding your data is the `skimr` package. Let's install it with the `install.packages()` command.

```{r}
install.packages("skimr")
```

Now we can use it. There is one main function called `skim()` in `skimr`.

One thing to keep in mind: you only need to install a package with `install.packages()` once. Once it's installed, you can use the `library()` command to load it up.

Here we're loading the `skimr` library and then we're using a function in it called `skim()`:

```{r}
library(skimr)
skim(brca_clinical)

```

### `visdat`

Another useful package for visualizing your data is `visdat`. It's especially useful for understanding missing values in your data.

```{r}
install.packages("visdat")
```

```{r}
library(visdat)
#To learn more about a package, you can usually add "-package" to the package name
help("visdat-package")

vis_dat(brca_clinical)
```

## Introducing `ggplot2`

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=7023>

```{r}

```

Click the button below to load up the graphic.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/ggplot2_exploratory.png")

```

Now that we've loaded our data as a `data.frame`, we can begin to start doing things with it.

Let's start with visualizing the data.

## Working Towards a Graph

We're going to work towards the following graph today:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/days_to_last_followup.png")
```

Here's a visual summary of the different parts we're talking about today.

## `ggplot2`: A Grammar of Graphics

`ggplot2` is an extremely powerful software library for visualization.

The `gg` is short for Grammar of Graphics, which means that visualizations are expressed in a very specific way.

## Learning to read `ggplot2` code

A `ggplot2` graphic consists of a:

-   `mapping` of variables in `data` to
-   `aes()`thetic attributes of
-   `geom_`etric objects.

In code, this is translated as:

    #start the plot with ggplot()

    ggplot(data = brca_clinical) +   


    # make the mapping
    # map the x-axis to age_at_diagnosis

          aes(
              x = age_at_diagnosis, 
              y = days_to_birth 
              ) +

    # add the geometry
      geom_point()

Things to note: we chain these three things together with `+` (plus sign). I tend to read the plus as `then`.

[aes() function - mapping variables to visual properties of the graph]

## Challenge

Based on the Age versus Days to Last Followup graph above, map the appropriate variables in `brca_clinical` to the x, and y aesthetics. Run your plot. Is it what you expected?

What's missing compared to the graph above?

```{r}
ggplot(data = brca_clinical) +

  aes(x = _____ ,
      y = _____ ) +
  
  geom_point()


```

## Simple arithmetic

<https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=7602>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=7602")

```

Huh. `age_at_diagnosis` is in days, not years. We can fix that by dividing it by 365:

```{r}
ggplot(data = brca_clinical) +

  aes(x = age_at_diagnosis / 365 ,
      y = days_to_last_follow_up ) +
  
  geom_point()


```

## Color

We can also map a `character` variable to our graph to color.

Try mapping `gender` to `color`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = brca_clinical) +

  aes(x = age_at_diagnosis / 365 ,
      y = days_to_last_follow_up,  
      color = _____) +
  
  geom_point() 
```

## Titles

We can add more details to our graph. We can add a title using the `labs()` function:

```{r}
ggplot(data = brca_clinical) +

  aes(x = age_at_diagnosis / 365 ,
      y = days_to_last_follow_up,  
      color = gender) +
  
  geom_point() +
  
  labs(title="Age versus Days to Last followup") 

```

## Changing the Axis Labels

We can change the x-axis titles and the y-axis titles using the `xlab()` (short for x label) and `ylab()` functions:

```{r}
ggplot(data = brca_clinical) +

  aes(x = age_at_diagnosis / 365 ,
      y = days_to_last_follow_up,  
      color = gender) +
  
  geom_point() +
  
  ggtitle("Age versus Days to Last followup") +
  
  xlab("Age at Diagnosis (Years)") + 
  
  ylab("Days to Follow Up")

```

Now we've re-created the above plot! Let's save it using `ggsave()`. `ggsave()` saves the last created plot to a file. We'll save it as a `jpg` file. `ggsave()` is smart enough to know that we want to save it as a `jpg` from adding the extension `.jpg` to our filename.

```{r}
ggsave("follow-up-plot.jpg")
```

## Accessing columns

One way to get at a column in a `data.frame` is to use the `$` operator.

```{r}
brca_clinical$tumor_stage

```

We won't be using this very often (in fact, part of the reason to use the `tidyverse` is that we can avoid using this), but I just want you to be aware of it because it's used in the below section.

## Importing data from other software with `haven` (Optional)

Link to video: <https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=8102>

```{r}
vembedr::embed_url("https://youtu.be/EJ6_DEhC8v4?t=8102")
```

The package `haven` allows us to import data in other software formats, including SAS, Stata, or SPSS data.

Here is an example reading in a SAS data set:

```{r}
library(haven)
mtsas <- read_sas("data/mtcars.sas7bdat")
head(mtsas)
```

For SPSS, the function we need is `read_sav()`

while for Stata, the function we need is `read_dta()`.

These all read in the data as tibbles. If the data is in SAS export (.xpt) format, we can use the `read_xpt()` function. We can also export data into these formats using the `write_*` versions of these functions such as `write_sas()`.

Often, the data set from these software have additional attributes, such as labels. You can read more about dealing with these attributes in the `haven` vignettes: <https://haven.tidyverse.org/articles/semantics.html>

Here, we have downloaded data from the CDC's National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey located and described at: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/datasets_documentation_related.htm#data>

This is a very large SPSS data set from one year (2015) of the survey. We can read it in using `{haven}`, and note that many of the variables have labeled attributes ("dbl+lbl" format in `glimpse`):

```{r}
namcs <- read_sav("data/namcs2015-spss.sav")
glimpse(namcs[,1:5])
```

When we print one of the columns, we see the labels printed at the bottom:

```{r}
namcs$RACEUN[1:10]
```

We can see more detail with `str()`, including the column label better defining the value "Patient race - unimputed":

```{r}
str(namcs$RACEUN)
```

But note that the values of the vector are the numeric values. This can be cumbersome for analysis, and as stated in the [haven conversion vignette](https://haven.tidyverse.org/articles/semantics.html), the goal of `haven` is not to give you a data set and labels to use for analysis, but to give an intermediate data set that can be processed and wrangled into the analysis data set that you want to use. One such way is to convert these labeled columns to factors with the `haven` function `as_factor()`:

```{r}
namcs <- namcs %>% mutate(
  race_fac = as_factor(RACEUN)
)
head(namcs$race_fac)
levels(namcs$race_fac)
```

Now, we have preserved the labels in R, and we could further convert this vector to a character vector with `as.character()` if that works better for our analysis pipeline.

### For Further Information

Importing labeled data can be challenging. This is a good post that delves more into loaded labeled data with `{haven}`:
